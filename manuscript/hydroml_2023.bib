  abstract = {Abstract. The geographic distribution of streams and rivers drives a multitude of patterns and processes in hydrology, geomorphology, geography, and ecology. Therefore, a hydrographic network that accurately delineates both small streams and large rivers, along with their topographic and topological properties, with equal precision would be indispensable in the earth sciences. Currently, available global hydrographies do not feature small headwater streams in great detail. However, these headwaters are vital because they are estimated to contribute to more than 70\,\% of overall stream length. We aimed to fill this gap by using the MERIT Hydro digital elevation model at 3\,arcsec ({$\sim$}90\,m at the Equator) to derive a globally seamless, standardised hydrographic network, the ``Hydrography90m'', with corresponding stream topographic and topological information. A central feature of the network is the minimal upstream contributing area, i.e. flow accumulation, of 0.05\,km2 (or 5\,ha) to initiate a stream channel, which allowed us to extract headwater stream channels in great detail. By employing a suite of GRASS GIS hydrological modules, we calculated the range-wide upstream flow accumulation and flow direction to delineate a total of 1.6~million drainage basins and extracted globally a total of 726~million unique stream segments with their corresponding sub-catchments. In addition, we computed stream topographic variables comprising stream slope, gradient, length, and curvature attributes as well as stream topological variables to allow for network routing and various stream order classifications. We validated the spatial accuracy and flow accumulation of Hydrography90m against NHDPlus HR, an independent, national high-resolution hydrographic network dataset of the United States. Our validation shows that the newly developed Hydrography90m has the highest spatial precision and contains more headwater stream channels compared to three other global hydrographic datasets. This comprehensive approach provides a vital and long-overdue baseline for assessing actual streamflow in headwaters and opens new research avenues for high-resolution studies of surface water worldwide. Hydrography90m thus offers significant potential to facilitate the assessment of freshwater quantity and quality, inundation risk, biodiversity, conservation, and resource management objectives in a globally comprehensive and standardised manner. The Hydrography90m layers are available at https://doi.org/10.18728/igb-fred-762.1 (Amatulli et~al.,~2022a), and while they can be used directly in standard GIS applications, we recommend the seamless integration with hydrological modules in open-source QGIS and GRASS GIS software to further customise the data and derive optimal utility from it.},

Earth scientists, while often supportive of more transparency in the methods they develop, are concerned by this recent requirement and puzzled by its multiple implications. This paper therefore presents a reflection on the numerous aspects of sharing code and data in the general field of computer modeling of dynamic Earth processes. Our reflection is based on 10\,years of development of an open source model called the Routing Application for Parallel Computation of Discharge (RAPID) that simulates the propagation of water flow waves in river networks. Three consecutive but distinct phases of the sharing process are highlighted here: opening, exposing, and consolidating. Each one of these phases is presented as an independent and tractable increment aligned with the various stages of code development and justified based on the size of the users community. Several aspects of digital scholarship are presented here including licenses, documentation, websites, citable code and data repositories, and testing.

  abstract = {Abstract             Inland water bodies and their surface hydrologic connections are active components in the landscape, influencing multiple ecological processes that can propagate to broad-scale phenomena such as regional nutrient and carbon cycles and metapopulation dynamics. However, while lake, wetland, and stream abundance has been estimated at regional and global extents, less attention has been paid to freshwater connectivity attributes among aquatic systems at macroscales. Thus, regional to continental patterns of freshwater abundance and connectivity are poorly understood. We measured lake, wetland, and stream abundance and surface connectivity attributes (i.e., landscape position within stream networks) at a subcontinental extent in the Midwest and Northeast United States to characterize macroscale spatial patterns of the freshwater landscape (i.e., abundance and connectivity attributes of lakes, wetlands, and streams). We found that lake and wetland abundance exhibited opposite spatial patterns from stream density that generally followed glaciation extent boundaries---lake and wetland abundance was high north of the glaciation boundary, whereas stream density was high south of the glaciation boundary. Freshwater connectivity attributes exhibited distinct spatial patterns as defined by our integrated freshwater clusters and revealed a layer of complexity not captured by abundance measures. Patterns of freshwater abundance and connectivity in the study extent were associated primarily with glaciation and secondarily with hydrogeomorphic (e.g., surficial geology and topography), climate (e.g., runoff), and land-use (e.g., agriculture) variables, providing insight into potential drivers of freshwater composition and distribution. The connectivity spatial patterns observed suggest that relying solely on freshwater abundance measures in macroscale analyses omits unique information on the structural attributes of freshwater systems that can be critical to key ecological processes. Adopting an integrated freshwater landscape framework to study and manage freshwaters is essential as freshwater systems face broad-scale disturbances that may alter hydrologic connections and subsequently may impact ecosystem processes and services.},

Here we present a methodology for estimating ToE for individual climate models, and use it to make maps of ToE for surface air temperature (SAT) based on the CMIP3 global climate models. Consistent with previous studies we show that the median ToE occurs several decades sooner in low latitudes, particularly in boreal summer, than in mid-latitudes. We also show that the median ToE in the Arctic occurs sooner in boreal winter than in boreal summer. A key new aspect of our study is that we quantify the uncertainty in ToE that arises not only from inter-model differences in the magnitude of the climate change signal, but also from large differences in the simulation of natural climate variability. The uncertainty in ToE is at least 30 years in the regions examined, and as much as 60 years in some regions. Alternative emissions scenarios lead to changes in both the median ToE (by a decade or more) and its uncertainty. The SRES B1 scenario is associated with a very large uncertainty in ToE in some regions.

  abstract = {Abstract             A vector-river network explicitly uses realistic geometries of river reaches and catchments for spatial discretization in a river model. This enables improving the accuracy of the physical properties of the modeled river system, compared to a gridded river network that has been used in Earth System Models. With a finer-scale river network, resolving smaller-scale river reaches, there is a need for efficient methods to route streamflow and its constituents throughout the river network. The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) develop a new method to decompose river networks into hydrologically independent tributary domains, where routing computations can be performed in parallel; and (2) perform global river routing simulations with two global river networks, with different scales, to examine the computational efficiency and the differences in discharge simulations at various temporal scales. The new parallelization method uses a hierarchical decomposition strategy, where each decomposed tributary is further decomposed into many sub-tributary domains, enabling hybrid parallel computing. This parallelization scheme has excellent computational scaling for the global domain where it is straightforward to distribute computations across many independent river basins. However, parallel computing for a single large basin remains challenging. The global routing experiments show that the scale of the vector-river network has less impact on the discharge simulations than the runoff input that is generated by the combination of land surface model and meteorological forcing. The scale of vector-river networks needs to consider the scale of local hydrologic features such as lakes that are to be resolved in the network.           ,              Plain Language Summary             This study introduces a parallel computing method for river models that simulate discharges at many nested river reaches. The new parallelization method enables us to reduce the computation time over the global domain including numerous independent river basins, but we face difficulty in reducing the computation time for simulations over single river basins even using increased computing resources. Nevertheless, the improved computational efficiency enables us to perform a series of daily global river discharge simulations, one of which simulates at {$\sim$}3 million reaches. We found that the simulation using coarser scale river data including 300,000 reaches were more similar to the results with the fine-scale data for longer time scale analysis such as annual scale than the daily scale analysis.           ,              Key Points                                                                Hierarchical river network decomposition enables hybrid parallel computing and improves the computational efficiency of global river models                                                     Runoff input and routing schemes have larger impacts on river flow simulations than the vector river network with different catchment scales                                                     The scale of vector river networks needs to consider the scale of local hydrologic features such as lakes that are to be resolved},

Detection and monitoring of ponds using satellite imagery has been extremely difficult and many water maps are biased toward lakes ({$>$}0.01~km               2               ). We leverage high-resolution (3~m) optical satellite imagery from Planet Labs and deep learning methods to map seasonal changes in pond and lake areal extent across four regions in Alaska. Our water maps indicate that changes in open water extent over the snow-free season are especially pronounced in ponds. To investigate potential impacts of seasonal changes in pond area on carbon emissions, we provide a case study of open water methane emission budgets using the new water maps.

We used deep learning and high-resolution (3~m) satellite imagery to map and monitor seasonal changes in the areal extent of lakes and small ponds across four regions in Alaska. The resulting water maps accounted for considerably more water coverage than existing products.

  abstract = {Abstract. Ponds and lakes are abundant in Arctic permafrost lowlands. They play an important role in Arctic wetland ecosystems by regulating carbon, water, and energy fluxes and providing freshwater habitats. However, ponds, i.e., waterbodies with surface areas smaller than 1.\,0\,{\texttimes}\,104\,m2, have not been inventoried on global and regional scales. The Permafrost Region Pond and Lake (PeRL) database presents the results of a circum-Arctic effort to map ponds and lakes from modern (2002--2013) high-resolution aerial and satellite imagery with a resolution of 5\,m or better. The database also includes historical imagery from 1948 to 1965 with a resolution of 6\,m or better. PeRL includes 69 maps covering a wide range of environmental conditions from tundra to boreal regions and from continuous to discontinuous permafrost zones. Waterbody maps are linked to regional permafrost landscape maps which provide information on permafrost extent, ground ice volume, geology, and lithology. This paper describes waterbody classification and accuracy, and presents statistics of waterbody distribution for each site. Maps of permafrost landscapes in Alaska, Canada, and Russia are used to extrapolate waterbody statistics from the site level to regional landscape units. PeRL presents pond and lake estimates for a total area of 1.\,4\,{\texttimes}\,106\,km2 across the Arctic, about 17\,\% of the Arctic lowland (\,{$<$}\,\,300\,m\,a.s.l.) land surface area. PeRL waterbodies with sizes of 1.\,0\,{\texttimes}\,106\,m2 down to 1.\,0\,{\texttimes}\,102\,m2 contributed up to 21\,\% to the total water fraction. Waterbody density ranged from 1.\,0\,{\texttimes}\,10 to 9.\,4\,{\texttimes}\,101\,km-2. Ponds are the dominant waterbody type by number in all landscapes representing 45--99\,\% of the total waterbody number. The implementation of PeRL size distributions in land surface models will greatly improve the investigation and projection of surface inundation and carbon fluxes in permafrost lowlands.

  abstract = {Ponds and lakes are abundant in Arctic permafrost lowlands. They play an important role in Arctic wetland ecosystems by regulating carbon, water, and energy fluxes and providing freshwater habitats. However, ponds, i.e., waterbodies with surface areas smaller than 1.0 {\texttimes} 10**4 m**2, have not been inventoried on global and regional scales. The Permafrost Region Pond and Lake (PeRL) database presents the results of a circum-Arctic effort to map ponds and lakes from modern (2002-2013) high-resolution aerial and satellite imagery with a resolution of 5 m or better. The database also includes historical imagery from 1948 to 1965 with a resolution of 6 m or better. PeRL includes 69 maps covering a wide range of environmental conditions from tundra to boreal regions and from continuous to discontinuous permafrost zones. Waterbody maps are linked to regional permafrost landscape maps which provide information on permafrost extent, ground ice volume, geology, and lithology. This paper describes waterbody classification and accuracy, and presents statistics of waterbody distribution for each site. Maps of permafrost landscapes in Alaska, Canada, and Russia are used to extrapolate waterbody statistics from the site level to regional landscape units. PeRL presents pond and lake estimates for a total area of 1.4 {\texttimes} 10**6 km**2 across the Arctic, about 17 \% of the Arctic lowland ( \&lt; 300 m a.s.l.) land surface area. PeRL waterbodies with sizes of 1.0 {\texttimes} 10**6 m**2 down to 1.0 {\texttimes} 10**2 m**2 contributed up to 21 \% to the total water fraction. Waterbody density ranged from 1.0 {\texttimes} 10 to 9.4 {\texttimes} 10**1/km{$^2$}. Ponds are the dominant waterbody type by number in all landscapes representing 45-99 \% of the total waterbody number. The implementation of PeRL size distributions in land surface models will greatly improve the investigation and projection of surface inundation and carbon fluxes in permafrost lowlands.},

  abstract = {This paper aims at generating a long-term consistent record of Landsat-derived remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) products, which are central for producing downstream aquatic science products (e.g., concentrations of total suspended solids). The products are derived from Landsat-5 and Landsat-7 observations leading to Landsat-8 era to enable retrospective analyses of inland and nearshore coastal waters. In doing so, the data processing was built into the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) followed by vicariously calibrating Landsat-7 and -5 data using reference in situ measurements and near-concurrent ocean color products, respectively. The derived Rrs products are then validated using (a) matchups using the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data measured by in situ radiometers, i.e., AERONET-OC, and (b) ocean color products at select sites in North America. Following the vicarious calibration adjustments, it is found that the overall biases in Rrs products are significantly reduced. The root-mean-square errors (RMSE), however, indicate noticeable uncertainties due to random and systematic noise. Long-term (since 1984) seasonal Rrs composites over 12 coastal and inland systems are further evaluated to explore the utility of Landsat archive processed via SeaDAS. With all the qualitative and quantitative assessments, it is concluded that with careful algorithm developments, it is possible to discern natural variability in historic water quality conditions using heritage Landsat missions. This requires the changes in Rrs exceed maximum expected uncertainties, i.e., 0.0015 [1/sr], estimated from mean RMSEs associated with the matchups and intercomparison analyses. It is also anticipated that Landsat-5 products will be less susceptible to uncertainties in turbid waters with Rrs(660) {$>$} 0.004 [1/sr], which is equivalent of {\textasciitilde}1.2\% reflectance. Overall, end-users may utilize heritage Rrs products with ``fitness-for-purpose'' concept in mind, i.e., products could be valuable for one application but may not be viable for another. Further research should be dedicated to enhancing atmospheric correction to account for non-negligible near-infrared reflectance in CDOM-rich and extremely turbid waters.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Lakes are important natural resources and carbon gas emitters and are undergoing rapid changes worldwide in response to climate change and human activities. A detailed global characterization of lakes and their long-term dynamics does not exist, which is however crucial for evaluating the associated impacts on water availability and carbon emissions. Here, we map 3.4 million lakes on a global scale, including their explicit maximum extents and probability-weighted area changes over the past four decades. From the beginning period (1984--1999) to the end (2010--2019), the lake area increased across all six continents analyzed, with a net change of +46,278 km               2               , and 56\% of the expansion was attributed to reservoirs. Interestingly, although small lakes ({$<$}1 km               2               ) accounted for just 15\% of the global lake area, they dominated the variability in total lake size in half of the global inland lake regions. The identified lake area increase over time led to higher lacustrine carbon emissions, mostly attributed to small lakes. Our findings illustrate the emerging roles of small lakes in regulating not only local inland water variability, but also the global trends of surface water extent and carbon emissions.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Human-controlled reservoirs have a large influence on the global water cycle. While global hydrological models use generic parameterizations to model dam operations, the representation of reservoir regulation is still lacking in many Earth system models. Here we implement and evaluate a widely used reservoir parametrization in the global river-routing model mizuRoute, which operates on a vector-based river network resolving individual lakes and reservoirs and is currently being coupled to an Earth system model. We develop an approach to determine the downstream area over which to aggregate irrigation water demand per reservoir. The implementation of managed reservoirs is evaluated by comparing them to simulations ignoring inland waters and simulations with reservoirs represented as natural lakes using (i)~local simulations for 26 individual reservoirs driven by observed inflows and (ii)~global-domain simulations driven by runoff from the Community Land Model. The local simulations show the clear added value of the reservoir parametrization, especially for simulating storage for large reservoirs with a multi-year storage capacity. In the global-domain application, the implementation of reservoirs shows an improvement in outflow and storage compared to the no-reservoir simulation, but a similar performance is found compared to the natural lake parametrization. The limited impact of reservoirs on skill statistics could be attributed to biases in simulated river discharge, mainly originating from biases in simulated runoff from the Community Land Model. Finally, the comparison of modelled monthly streamflow indices against observations highlights that including dam operations improves the streamflow simulation compared to ignoring lakes and reservoirs. This study overall underlines the need to further develop and test runoff simulations and water management parameterizations in order to improve the representation of anthropogenic interference of the terrestrial water cycle in Earth system models.},
